# fbSDK4-Parse1.7.5-Swift1.2-iOS8-login-and-interact

These files ahve been used for anothe app I made with the Facebook SDK 4 , PArse 1.7.5, on Swift 1.2. I used XCode 6. 

I installed all the packages including Parse, Facebook, and more, using cocoapods.

I did not include the storyboards, but the required butttons for login are easy to understand from reading WelcomeViewController.swift.

Regards,
